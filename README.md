# Machine-learning-Project
ML Project, in which data is live streamed on the user interface, and stored simuntaneously in database for paitent history.  for streaming the data we use pyspark and data is stored in MongoDB.  In second task, with the help of datasheet (Diabetes, Heart). New paitent probability of having diabetes and cardiac arrest with the help of different Machine learning algorithms(Ramdom forest, Logistic regression, naive bayes, ANN, CNN and SVM) and training the model along with it to find most accuracy.  In third task, We use FbProphet to forcast the graph using prior data stored in database to train the prophet model, with large set of data in order the find the anomaly before hand.
